<p style="padding:10px;">Holistic
  Belly Dance with Rebecca is an approach that not only borrows from a variety
  of movement traditions, but one that incorporates them towards honoring, respecting,
  and celebrating the female body in whatever age-shape-size-color the Goddess
within wishes to be expressed.</p>
<div style="padding:0 10px;">
  <p>  As the studio
  space is mirror-free, we will take the opportunity to reflect back our dance
  motions to each other, as well as emphasize visualization, the most powerful
form of physical manifestation.</p>
<p align="left">  If all this
  sounds too spiritually lofty to you, just come and have fun and learn one of
  the most ancient art forms created for women.<br />
</p>
