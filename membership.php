			  <p><strong>Hello Spirit Room Friends</strong></p>
			  <p>Not all of you were here on the March 2010 evening when the Great Winter
			    Crow Show opened but it seemed like half of Fargo Moorhead attended. We
			    had 73 visual entries this year and a program that included dance by Cameron
			    MacKenzie, Native American flute music by Merlin Londo, and poetry by Mark
			    Vinz and Kevin Corollo.</p>
			  <p>On Friday, July&nbsp; 16th, we will pack the house again with the return
			    of Eric Taylor as part of our Listening Room music series. Meanwhile,
			    Dana Cooper will appear on May 7th 
			    and Michael Pink on August 20.&nbsp; The Listening Room is growing with
			    each monthly performance in the quiet space of our gallery.</p>
			  <p>After ten years in our space, we have bumped through the wall to the south
			    and now have twice the space than we had a year ago.&nbsp; With the expanded
			    space, now called the Lotus Studio after our logo, we hold additional classes
			    with Maureen McDonald&rsquo;s School of Irish and International Dance, and
			    Margeret Sam teaching traditional dance of India. </p>
			  <p>In addition, Dr David Myers has joined us as a partner creating the Center
			    for Interfaith Projects. He has rented the west end of our new space overlooking
			    Broadway and will be working with us to develop programming for the Lotus
			    Studio.</p>
			  <p>With the focus on Iceland this year, Kyja Kristjansson, Director of MSUM
			    Film Studies Department, will produce an exhibit of stills from her documentary
			    about Iceland.&nbsp; In Gallery II, we will feature photographs by Chris
			    Nelson of Hofsos, Iceland, and in Gallery III, Icelandic maps and the PPTV
			    video, &ldquo;Windows of Brimness&rdquo;- a documentary featuring the late
			    Bill Holm. Merry Helm will exhibit new photos of the Sheyenne River Valley
			    in July 2010. Both exhibits speak to a spiritual relationship to the land.</p>
			  <p>The variety mentioned here is just the tip of the iceberg. This is made
			    possible by your continued support and dedication to our mission. We have
			    been here for you through thick and thin, dedicating our work to uplifting
			    the community.</p>
			  <p>But we need your continued support, especially with our expansion construction.&nbsp; Your
			    contributions are 100% deductible.&nbsp; We need your help to continue our
			    commitment to bringing you quality programming and extraordinary insights
			    and experiences. </p>
			  <p>Please consider becoming a member, increasing your membership level, or
			    making a contribution beyond your membership to our expansion project.&nbsp; We
			    appreciate all our friends who support us and look forward to being here
			    for you for the next ten years.</p>
			  <p>Please join our family of friends at the Spirit Room!</p>
			  <p>Yours Truly,<br />
			    Dawn Morgan</p>
