          Giving Voice: A Theater Writing Workshop</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social justice begins with giving voice.
              Writers and non-writers are welcome in the safe and warm atmosphere
              of this workshop where we will 
              explore what makes a good monologue dramatically satisfying, and
              how it 
              can be used on its own, or as part of a larger theater piece. We
              will take time 
              to write and to reflect. If you are working on a monologue, please
              bring it 
              with you, or come start a new one. Personal and issue-oriented
              writing is 
              welcome. The workshop is presented by Irene O&rsquo;Garden, nationally 
              recognized, award winning author, poet, and playwright from Minneapolis, 
              and New York City. Irene is the author of <strong><em>Little Heart</em></strong>,
              the play about 
              Corita Kent&rsquo;s life and work, making its Midwest Regional
              Premier 
              as part of the Bright Bird exhibition and collaborative project
              with Theater B, Presentation Sisters, People Escaping Poverty Project,
              and the Spirit 
              Room Gallery. The project is designed to bring new voices in our
              community into the human rights and social justice dialogue, and
              to 
            reinvigorate those already in the work. </p>          </td>
