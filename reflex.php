<p>Our feet and hands talk to our whole body throughout the day making it possible
  for us to walk and move. They provide a direct line of communication with the
  entire body.&nbsp; Foot and hand reflexology eases the stress caused by the
demands of our everyday lives.</p>



<p>Reflexology is a science which deals with the principle that there are reflex
  areas in the feet and hands which correspond to all of the glands, organs and
  parts of the body.&nbsp; It relieves stress and tension, improves nerve and
  blood supply, promotes the unblocking of nerve impulses and aids the body in
  achieving a more balanced state.</p>
<p>When there is a problem in the body, one can trace it to a sensitive area
  on the foot.&nbsp; By working the sensitive reflex points on the foot, we stimulate
  a healing process to the corresponding area in the body.&nbsp; Reflexology
  is a tool to help the body heal itself.</p>
<p>Annette Marchand is a professional reflexologist who has studied at the International
  Institute of Reflexology, specifically with George Balut, director of&nbsp; the
  Institute.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s Terry followed a winding path
  as a result of his interests in spirituality and health.&nbsp; Taking him from
  UND to California to explore those interests, he found healing remedies with
  swamis and gurus such as Harish Jorie&nbsp; and other Hindu practitioners.
  Over the years, he has continued his studies through Eselen Institute. Terry
  was recertified in reflexology in 2006 through studies with Claire Marie Miller
  in Omaha.&nbsp; He practices reflexology in the Fargo Moorhead area and currently
resides in his new home on the family&rsquo;s old homestead in rural Clay County.</p>
