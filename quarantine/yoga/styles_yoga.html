<h2>Styles of Yoga</h2>
  By Dawn Morgan
<p>There are various schools of yoga. Practitioners new to yoga can try different styles to determine which approach works for them.  New students will find that even within a certain style of yoga, individual teachers vary greatly.  They will also find that one style may be good now and may change completely later on. There are also varying degrees of complexity within the styles, resulting in children's classes, maternity classes and senior's classes. There are also beginning through advanced classes within the various styles.</p>
<p>Most schools follow basic elements of yoga but vary according to the influence of a particular teacher.  Hatha or Physical Yoga is one of eight limbs of yoga that date back thousands of years in the history of India. The eight limbs of yoga are systems of discipline and personal development practiced by millions of Indians historically. The four most common Hatha Yoga schools are Iyengar Yoga, Sivananda Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga and Kundalini Yoga.</p>
<p><strong>Iyengar Yoga</strong> is taught by B.K.S. Iyengar, who was born in 
  India in 1918 and still lives there today. Students travel to India and stay 
  for long periods of study, sometimes years, to learn his approach. Traditionally, 
  yoga has been taught master to student without written texts. Iyengar's book, 
  Light on Yoga, published in 1966, has enabled yoga to spread all over the world 
  and has been translated into eighteen languages. Iyengar Yoga is precise and 
  emphasizes angular postures and the use of props such as straps, blocks and 
  ropes to move the body into the asanas (positions). The asanas are held for 
  increasingly longer periods of time as the practitioner advances in the discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Sivananda Yoga</strong> was developed by a medical doctor, Swami Sivananda, 
  born in South India in 1887. Swami Shishni Denanagda introduced Sivananda's 
  style of yoga to the West in the 1950's. Sivananda Yoga is based on 12 key postures, 
  sun salutations, breathing techniques, meditation and chanting. Because Sivananda 
  Yoga works with variations on the basic postures, it is one of the most versatile 
  and easily adaptable styles to various levels of physical development. Classes 
  can be easily adapted to the student, graduating from a gentle to a rigorous 
  approach.</p>
<p><strong>Ashtanga Yoga</strong>, taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, is based on 
  an ancient manuscript called the Yoga Korunta. It is a system of Hatha Yoga, 
  thought to be the practice intended by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras. This text 
  was deciphered and organized by Pattabhi Jois in the 1930's and is currently 
  one of the most popular styles of yoga worldwide. This style of yoga is rigorous 
  and athletic and may be the most demanding style of yoga. Beginners can work 
  with individual postures before progressing toward the Primary Series and onward.</p>
<p><strong>Kundalini Yoga</strong> is based on the teachings of the Sikh master, 
  Yogi Bhajan who introduced the system to the West in 1969 and founded the 3HO 
  Organization (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) here in the United Sates. This 
  form of Yoga makes use of breathing techniques, particularly the "Breath of Fire" while holding postures. It focuses on hand and fingers gestures, body 
  locks, chanting, singing and meditation. Kundalini Yoga aims to awaken the energy 
  reserves at the base of the spine and raise this energy up through the chakras 
  (energy centers) along the spine to enhance awakening to greater levels of energy, 
  clarity and joy.</p>
<p><strong>Vinyasa Yoga</strong> is sequenced yoga postures with the primary focus 
  on the breath. The breath leads the way from one posture to the next, therefore, 
  the mind must know exactly where the breath is to flow evenly. Another aspect 
  of Vinyasa practice is observation of mental discourse and mental patterning. 
  Students concentrate the mind in the present, allowing the mind to become calm 
  and steady. Vinyasa Yoga carefully balances each asana with counter postures. 
  The sequences change as the physical body changes with the practice. Vinyasa 
  Yoga emphasizes individual instruction. More advanced Vinyasa sequences are 
  combined with sacred prayers and mantras. The use of prayers and mantras usually 
  begins after many years of yoga sequencing when the element of earth is tamed, 
  the physiological body has been calmed and the mind remains passive throughout 
  the yoga sequences. </p>
<p> <strong>Anusara Yoga</strong> was founded by John Friend in 1997 and emphasizes 
  the meaning of the word "Anusara," as "Flowing with Grace." Practitioners focus 
  on opening the heart and accepting all experience as divine: sensation, perception, 
  emotion and thought. The asanas are seen as a dance of "flowing with Supreme 
  Consciousness". Therefore, light-heartedness, play and joyful creativity are 
  part of the yoga practice. Anusara Yoga teaches five Universal Principles of 
  Alignment, with study of energetic loops and spirals within the body that help 
  in finding the best form for each individual. </p>
<p> <strong>Kripalu Yoga</strong> has been developed at the Kripalu Center for 
  Yoga and Health in Massachusetts. Kripalu is the largest retreat center for 
  Yoga and healing in the United States. A non-profit organization begun thirty 
  years ago, Kripalu has brought yoga into mainstream locations such as schools, 
  senior citizen centers, hospitals and prisons. Kripalu Yoga would be described 
  as a gentle yoga.</p>
<p> <strong>Atma Yoga</strong> was developed by Christopher Baxter following thirty 
  years of teaching yoga at Kripalu. Having been trained in Iyengar Yoga and following 
  years of successive injuries from his precise and angular yoga practice, he 
  developed a style of yoga that combines postures based upon "core lift" (use 
  of the bondas) for central stability, and then adding breath and fluid movement. 
  For example, the tree balance posture is grounded with the roots into the earth. 
  Fluidity is added with movement of the branches. Stability, movement and joyfulness 
  are combined in Atma Yoga practice.</p>
<p><strong>Vajrasana Yoga</strong> is the style of yoga that evolved for Dawn 
  Morgan of the Spirit Room. Dawn has completed six levels of Shambhala Meditation 
  Training and has led meditation sessions at the Spirit Room for seven years. 
  Beginning yoga practice in the late sixties, she received a certification in 
  Atma Yoga in 2002. Dawn has combined Hatha Yoga, which is traditionally Hindu 
  or Sikh, with elements of Buddhist mindfulness training. Bringing body, mind 
  and emotion together encourages resting in the present and letting go of busyness 
  and tension. Vajrasana Yoga is practiced by relaxing with the outbreath, allowing 
  discursive thought to be released from the mind and rigidity released from the 
  body. When thoughts take one away from the present, the practitioner gently 
  comes back to the body and the breath. Spatial awareness and lack of inherent 
  solidity are explored within the body, the mind and the world. Practitioners 
  are encouraged to take the practice into daily life. By being stable, steady 
  and present in the world, assuming a posture of dignity and openness, we uplift 
  ourselves and others. Vajrasana Yoga is Contemplative Yoga.</p>
